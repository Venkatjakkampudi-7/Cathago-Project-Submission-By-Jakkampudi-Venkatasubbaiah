ML model is too large to upload so i am leaving the link to download the model

"https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased/blob/main/model.onnx"

Desination path: Model can be downloaded from here and in the project it has to placed in the folder called "NLP Model" with name as bert.onnx

This works or alternatively it can be downloaded using python and be saved with python transform and copy into the same destination
